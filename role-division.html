			|| INTRODUCTION ||
		</h2>
		<p>
			Data Science is without doubt the new 'it' industry of this century. Everyone's heard about it and talks about it, but not many people actually know what the phrase, 'Data Science', even means. And in the age in which information equals power, the phrase, 'Data Science', has become a convenient buzzword and is being thrown around everywhere, often incorrectly.
		</p>

		<p>
			Many people have asked us, is 'Data Science' even real science? Well, in order to ask that question, let's take a look at what 'science' even means. The Science Council defines 'science' as the following:
		</p>

		<p>
			"Science is the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence."
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, if we replace "Science" with "Data Science", and "natural and social world" with "Big Data", we end up with the following:
		</p>

		<p>
			"Data Science is the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of Big Data following a systematic methodology based on evidence."
		</p>

		<p>
			This is a pretty good definition of "Data Science". Data Scientists are given huge sets of data to work with. They then use various tools, such as regression analysis, classification, bootstrapping, and etc, to identify patterns, statistical significances, and correlations which are used as empirical evidences to back-up their claims and conclusions.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, the Big Data that are given to the Data Scientists, are almost always full of superfluous information and errors. They also need a place to store and a way to maintain the quality of the data in use. If Data Scientists were expected to perform all of these tasks along with their original responsibilities, the Data Science industry would not be as efficient as it is today. Therefore, there are many other roles within the industry that have been developed overtime to better specialize each tasks and establish a strong support network among each roles.
		</p>

		<P>
			Roles within Data Science can be broadly categorized into the following four groups:<br><br>
			1) Data Analyst<br><br>
			2) Data Scientist<br><br>
			3) Data Architect<br><br>
			4) Data Engineer<br><br>
			As you scroll down, we will explore through each of these roles, and by the end of it, hopefully everything will feel more clear and defined!

		<h2>
			|| DATA ANALYST - The Kitchen Assistant ||
		</h2>

		<p>
			It is easy to confuse the terms, "Data Analyst" and "Data Scientist". The biggest difference between Data Analysts and Data Scientists is that Data analysts DO NOT build new algorithms or develop new products, while Data Scientists do. They instead focus on cleaning and preparing the data used by Data Scientists.

		<p>
			An analogy that we can use to understand the nature of this job more easily is to think of Data Analysts as a kitchen assistant in a kitchen.<br>
			As we already know, a kitchen assistant is someone who performs various preparation tasks within the kitchen, such as washing, peeling, and cutting the cooking ingredients for the chefs.<br>
			Just replace "ingredients" with "data" and that will provide an intuitive explanation for the nature of the responsibilities of Data Analysts.

		<h2>
			|| DATA SCIENTIST - The Chef ||
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			While Data Analysts primarily focus on solving specific problems with already-existing set of tools, Data Scientists' nature of their job is more liberating in comparison.<br>
			<b>Data Scientists</b> often conduct undirectoed research where they <b>ask open-ended questions</b>, and during the process of answering these new questions, Data scientists often find themselves <b>developing new algorithms</b>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another striking division between Data Analysts and Data Scientists is that while Data Analysts track the growth of the firm as well as the quality of data, Data Scientists constantly look for ways to better optimize the current operation mehtod of the company. For example, Data Scientists often identify ways for firms to save money or to venture into new business opportunities.
		</p>

			<tr>
				<td>General Role</td>
				<td>
					- conduct undirected research<br>
					- make predictions and draw insightful conclusions<br>

					- look for opportunities for firm-wide improvement<br>

					- often help the firm save money or time<br>
					- identify new business opportunities

					- extensive background in math and statistics<br>
					- excellent communications and writing skills

		<p>
			Continuing the anology from before, if Data Analysts are like Kitchen Assistants, a Data Scientist is the Head Chef.<br>
			With the ingredients prepared by the Data Analysts, Data Scientists can fully unleash their creativity and create something new, wonderful, and useful, just as a Head Chef would create a gourmet recipe.
